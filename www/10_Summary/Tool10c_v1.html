<h2><b>1.  Describe site complexities and implications for achieving cleanup goals</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have an existing CSM that identifies relevant site conditions, nature and extent of contamination, and relevant attenuation processes?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Have you established the Geologic Heterogeneity at your site (Tool 8)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>How does the performance of past source remediation efforts at your site compare to the typical performance at other sites (Tool 4)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Have you estimated the impact of aliitional source remediation on remediation timeframe (Tool 3)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Have you estimated the Persistence Index for your site (Tool 10b)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>If a pump-and-treat system is in place:</li>
  <ul><li>Has a rebound test been performed that suggests concentrations increase significantly after shutting off pump(s)?</li></ul>
    
</ul>
<br>
<h2><b>2.  Perform quantitative assessment of concentration trends (e.g., “asymptotic” performance)</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>What is the current rate of source attenuation over time (based on max. concentration well or site-wide range) (Tool 1)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>What is the projected remediation timeframe at the current rate of source attenuation (Tool 1)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Are there lines of evidence that the performance of current remedial measures (e.g., pump-and-treat system) is asymptotic (based on concentration vs. time) (Tool 1)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Are the plume concentrations stable or decreasing (based on a site-wide assessment of wells) (Tool 2)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Is the plume footprint stable or decreasing (based on an evaluation of downgradient wells) (Tool 2)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Is the site-wide mass decreasing over time (Tool 2)?</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><b>3.  Identify alternative approaches for managing the site (MNA)</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Can you establish the bulk natural attenuation rate within the plume using concentration vs. distance data from the plume centerline during the pre-remediation period (Tool 5a)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Can you establish the natural attenuation rate within the plume using degradation rates from lab assays or other site-specific data (Tool 5b)?</li>
  <br>
  <li>Can you establish the current bulk natural attenuation rate within the plume using concentration vs. distance data from the plume centerline during the active remediation period (i.e., upgradient of a pump-and-treat system) (Tool 5c)?</li>
  <br>
  <ul><li>Has this attenuation rate been consistent over time (i.e., compare rates using concentration vs. distance data from different events) (Tool 5c)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is this rate comparable to the attenuation rate estimated using Tool 5a?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is this rate comparable to the attenuation rate estimated using Tool 5b?</li>
    <br>
    <li>If data are not available, can you install aliitional monitoring wells along the plume centerline to generate the necessary data?</li></ul>
    <br>
</ul>
<ul>   
  <br>
  <li>If a pump-and-treat system is in place and the goal is to shut it off and transition to MNA:</li> 
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Can the plume be allowed to expand beyond the farthest downgradient extraction well (Tool 5d)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is a downgradient area available to set up a plume assimilative capacity zone (Tool 5d)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Does the bulk attenuation rate within the plume (based on pre-remediation data (from Tool 5a), microcosm data (from Tool 5b), or current data (from Tool 5c)) indicate that the goal concentration will be met at the downgradient point of compliance (Tool 5d)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Has a rebound test has been performed?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Did concentrations increase in the relevant extraction well(s) during the rebound test?</li>
    <br>
    <li>If the maximum concentration after rebound is used to recalculate the bulk attenuation rate within the plume, does this new rate still indicate that the goal concentration will be met at the downgradient point of compliance (Tool 5d)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is the rate of contaminant capture at the extraction well(s) (based on concentration vs. time) similar to the rate of attenuation observed in monitoring well(s) prior to pumping (Tool 1)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is the recent rate of contaminant capture at the extraction well(s) (based on concentration vs. time during period when concentrations begin to plateau) less than the rate of attenuation observed in monitoring well(s) prior to pumping (Tool 1)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is the rate of contaminant capture at the extraction well(s) (based on concentration vs. time) similar to the rate of attenuation observed in plume monitoring wells located outside of the area of influence of the extraction wells (Tool 1)?</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <br>
  <li>If a pump-and-treat system is not in place:</li>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Is the plume stable (Tool 2)?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is the evidence to suggest that the processes contributing to plume stability are sustainable over a long period of time?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Does the potential for risk to receptors require implementing remediation or other measures that would preclude the use of MNA?</li>
    <br>
    <li>Is the estimated remediation timeframe for the site (based on applicable standards) considered reasonable (Tool 1)?</li>
    <br>
