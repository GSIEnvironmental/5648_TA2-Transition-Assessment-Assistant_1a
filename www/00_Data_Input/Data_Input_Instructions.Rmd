<h3><b>Data Input Instructions:</b></h3>

* Use (Year-Month-Day) format for dates (ex. 2022-01-01).
* You need at least four independent sampling events to get trends.
* Do not enter any Flags or < or > signs, must be numerical data.
* The tool can only process up to 30 wells.
* Most of the samples should have detected values.
* For non-detects, use either 1/2 the reporting limit (RL) or the RL. Don't use zero.
* Don't enter duplicate values, either use the average or the first of the two duplicates.


<h3><b>How to Edit Data:</b></h3>

* Data can be copied and pasted directly into table by selecting cell(s) and using the keyboard shortcut to paste (Windows: Ctrl + V).
* Double click cells to edit text.
* Additional rows can be added or removed by right clicking on cell(s).
* Clicking the bottom left corner of selected cell(s) allows the user to drag that information to additional cell(s).
* Cells highlighted red indicate the value within that cell is not in the correct format (ex. characters are present in column that can only include numerical data). 
* If the monitoring well name needs to be updated, use downloaded file from "Download Input File" button, revise the file with new monitoring well name, then upload the file by using "Upload Saved Data". The same procedure should be followed if you need to add new columns.
