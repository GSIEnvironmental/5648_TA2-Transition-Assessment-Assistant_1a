Source enhancement includes a wide range of options for the unsaturated zone or the saturated zone that can reduce loading from the source to groundwater and/or increase attenuation capacity. </p>

The goal of the technology is to contain the contaminants in place by ensuring the rate of attenuation are greater than the loading rate to the underlying groundwater, ensuring a stable and then shrinking plume. This approach is most applicable for areas such as landfills or unsaturated source zones where reducing recharge helps to limit mass discharge. It is implemented by either reducing the permeability of soils overlying a source zone or manipulating the soil water balance to limit percolation (ITRC, 2008). The main benefit of a cap/cover is that it can be used for relatively large areas of contaminated soil. However, there is a long-term maintenance limitation because this approach leaves the contamination in place as opposed to removing it.  Additionally, the cost of this method varies based on size of contaminated area and thickness of cap/cover required (EPA, 2012).</span></p>

Traditional barrier methods include slurry walls (cement/ bentonite) and sheet piling, while more recent approaches include impermeable membranes and bio-barriers. While different materials may be used, all containment barriers are aimed a reduction of mass loading. A primary benefit of containment barriers is the relatively low cost, especially if the containment area is large. However, there are long-term maintenance considerations since there is no removal of the contaminant (EPA, 2012).</span></p>

This can be achieved through configurations that include the minimal recontouring of local surface topography and/or lining drainage-pathways, as well as major changes including the surrounding topography recontouring and construction of lined drainage-ways (ITRC, 2008). These treatment methods can be specifically designed for a location, as opposed to a more generalized method like a cap/cover. The primary limitation of intercepting surface and storm water is that the cost can be greater when more significant changes of the land are required to intercept the surface water and stormwater flow (ITRC, 2008). </span></p>

The aim of this method is to reduce the flow through the source to decrease the mass flux of contaminants to downgradient plumes (ITRC, 2008). One advantage of this method is that it is minimally invasive and can be used in areas where the surface may not be operated on. Conversely, the method does not remove the contaminants from the source zone, but instead it   aims to stabilize and eventually shrink the plume, which may take time depending on the site conditions (ITRC, 2008). </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.25in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-size: 16px;'>Soil vapor extraction (SVE) is an in situ remedial technique that aims to remove volatile constituents present in the vadose zone and thereby reduce the mass loading to groundwater  The method relies on applying a vacuum to change the barometric pressure gradient and promote movement of vapors toward extraction wells (ITRC, 2008). This method generally results in higher performance when applied to light petroleum products such as gasoline or chlorinated solvents. The primary benefits of this technology are its relatively low energy and cost, although this may not be the case for sites where a longer-term operating period is necessary.  The main limitations are that its effectiveness depends on the soil type (particularly in low-permeability soils) and it may not be applicable for less volatile contaminants  (EPA, 2017). </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.25in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-size: 16px;'>Hydraulic control using plant-based methods relies on various types of vegetation to modify the flow of water and contaminants to reduce loading. By using the high rates of water uptake and evapotranspiration of certain plant species, this method is applicable to locations where the contaminants and/or water table are present are shallow. The aim is to promote direct plant uptake of contaminants and/or achieve a locally depressed water table by removing infiltration or groundwater at a rate quicker than its replenishment (ITRC, 2008). The main benefit of this process is that it is minimally invasive and may require little long-term maintenance once plantings are established. External factors that may interfere at some sites are extreme weather conditions and animals feeding on the vegetation. </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.25in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-size: 16px;'>This remediation method utilizes injection points to deliver amendments that will enhance attenuation capacity. This may include the injection of specific nutrients, substrates, or electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen) to promote natural biological (or biogeochemical) activity.  The key differences between this approach and conventional in situ bioremediation is that the amendment represents some element that is critical for stimulating natural attenuation and that it can be delivered in passive method that does not require multiple injection events.   The main benefits of this method are that the contaminant is removed rather than contained in the groundwater, and that the nutrient or other amendment can be tailored ed to the target contaminant and site conditions. </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.25in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-size: 16px;'> 

This method utilizes a permeable wall that is installed below the ground surface to remediate contaminated groundwater. The wall contains a reactive material such as iron, limestone, carbon or mulch which is selected based on its capacity to reduce the target contaminant through sorption, precipitation, chemical reactions, and/or biodegradation processes. The main benefit of this method is that it can be relatively inexpensive and low-effort remediation technique, with no energy required once it is in place. Additionally, once installed, no above-ground equipment is required during use  (EPA, 2021). The width and depth of the barrier will depend on site-specific factors like contaminant concentration, plume size, and groundwater velocity.  Total depths are typically 50 feet or less. The main limitation of this method is that the reactive material of the walls will eventually be depleted, such that the barrier will be  less effective at treating groundwater. If this occurs before the site-specific remedial goals are achieved, then the reactive material will have to be replaced to ensure continued treatment (EPA, 2021).

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.25in;font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;font-size: 16px;'> This remediation technique utilizes plants to promote the reduction of contaminant mass discharge in soil and groundwater through removal, degradation, or containment. This passive technique is most applicable to sites with shallow and low-to-moderate levels of contamination where uptake of contaminants by plants will readily occur through evapotranspiration. Plant-based methods have proven to be effective at removing a wide variety of contaminant types, including metals, explosives, pesticides, solvents, crude oil, landfill leachates, and hydrocarbons. One benefit of this method is that the cost of application is often lower than other physical or chemical techniques. Additionally, there are little long-term maintenance requirements (beyond occasional harvesting) if site conditions are favorable for continued growth of the planted species. In some settings, the performance of this approach may be impacted by extreme weather events (e.g., droughts) or animals feeding on the plants (EPA, 1999).</span></p>
